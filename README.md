[FENS](https://forum.fens.org/), the Federation of European Neuroscience Societies, will be having its next forum in July in Paris. This is the largest international neuroscience meeting in Europe, covering all fields of neuroscience research and comprising a range of symposia, technical workshops, plenary and special lectures and poster sessions as well as a number of social events.

[Open-Neuroscience](https://open-neuroscience.com/) in collaboration with the [Institut Pasteur neuroscience department](https://www.pasteur.fr/fr/nos-missions/recherche/neuroscience) and the [University of Sussex neuroscience department](https://www.sussex.ac.uk/research/centres/sussex-neuroscience/) organises a [satellite event](https://forum.fens.org/confirmed-satellite-events/) on Open Hardware Microscopy Development. The aim of this event is to bring into focus excellent open projects that permeate education, ease of access and data collection in advanced research environment.

The symposium will take place on the [Pasteur Institute campus](https://www.google.com/maps/d/viewer?ie=UTF8&view=map&ctz=-480&t=h&oe=UTF8&msa=0&mid=19wRKz7elGVxBkOFzIW-kZzMac0o&ll=48.840152518324395%2C2.311734201396951&z=18) in Paris (28 rue du Dr Roux). It will be divided into a [workshop session](#Morning-workshop-session) in the morning and a [series of talk](#Afternoon-talk-session) in the afternoon.

The workshops will be led by specialists in the field, which will also participate in the afternoon session. By the end of the session, participants will be invited to discuss what they have learned, how they could implement Open-Science microscope in their research, and/or how they could improve/modify their own setup by implementing Open tools on it and how their research protocol could benefit from it.

The afternoon session will be dedicated to a series of talks by our invited specialists. It will be split into two distinct topics/sub-sessions: Open-Source microscopy for education and improving ease of access to research equipment, and Open-Source microscopy for advanced research.

It is our goal that by the end of the day, participants get a full picture of the state of the art for Open-Source Microscopy. It is hoped that development and implementation of such tools and techniques in modern research units promote science accessibility and improve data reproducibility. Furthermore, an earlier and more systematic access to advanced science tools in education could only support shaping the research minds of tomorrow.

## Morning workshop session

9:00 – 12:00: Morning workshops

· [OpenFlexure](https://open-neuroscience.com/post/openflexure/):

A 3D printed flexure translation stage. The stage is capable of sub-micron-scale motion, with very small drift over time. Which makes it quite good, among other things, for time-lapse protocols that need to be done over days/weeks’ time, and under space restricted areas, such as fume hoods. Additional camera and servo motors, turns the stage into an automated microscope.

· [UC2](https://open-neuroscience.com/post/uc2/):

An open-source optical toolbox that simplifies the process of building optical setups, by combining 3D-printed cubes, each holding a specific component (e.g. lens, mirror) on a magnetic square-grid baseplate. The use of widely available consumables and 3D printing, together with documentation and software, offers an extremely low-cost and accessible alternative for both education and research areas.

· [FlyPi](https://open-labware.net/projects/flypi/):

A 3D-printable open-source platform for fluorescence microscopy, optogenetics and accurate temperature control. Designed for flexibiliy and low-cost, the “FlyPi” is an optical microscope designed for behavioural work with fruit flies, zebrafish or C. elegans. The system is based on a Raspberry Pi with camera, an Arduino microcontroller and a range of off-the-shelf electronic parts. A modular design provides for flexible control of a range of peripherals including options for optogenetic and thermogenetic stimulation and fluorescence microscopy. All mechanical parts are 3-D printed which includes a range of manual or motorised micropositioning options. The basic setup can be put together for below 100€. The low price means that it can be implemented in under-funded labs across the world, for classroom teaching in schools as well as by home-enthusiasts who are not part of the traditional scientific establishment.

· [LEGOLish-mot](http://legolish.org/authors/):

“Compared to many other fluorescence methods, such as confocal microscopy, that have been used in research labs for 30 years, Light Sheet Microscopy is so simple that it can be showcased to anyone and so hopefully it can clear up the perceived mystery surrounding what goes on in the dark rooms of research institutes,” explains Julien Colombelli. And he points out that “the latest and fully motorized version of LEGOLish will enable labs to test a basic Light Sheet system before deciding to purchase a commercial system”. In the current configuration, results generated by LEGOLish cost about 200 to 1000 times less than those produced by a commercial microscope.

[Institut Pasteur FabLab](https://research.pasteur.fr/fr/service/fablab-institut-pasteur-open-desk/)  & [Institut Pasteur CeRIS](https://openscience.pasteur.fr/):

The FabLab design and produces devices for Pasteur Researchers and help them develop their own prototypes to resolve research questions.
The CeRIS (Centre de Ressourece en Information Scientifique) informs and advises on the goals and practices of the three major Open Science domains: Scientific Edition, sharing and documentation of Open Data, and evaluation of research standards. The CeRIS mission is to sensitise the scientific community on Open Science practices to answer national and international enquiries.

· [TReND in Africa](https://trendinafrica.org/):

TReND is a charity supporting scientific capacity building across Africa. We run cutting edge biomedical training courses, provide universities with scientific equipment, run academic volunteering and outreach schemes, and support and work with African researchers.
-	Samyra Salek



· [Open Ephys](https://open-ephys.org/):

Open Ephys is a nonprofit based in Cambridge, Massachusetts, with team members distributed all around the world. Our mission is to advance our understanding of the brain by promoting community ownership of the tools we use to study it. Since Open Ephys was founded in 2014, we’ve made it possible to build an entire extracellular electrophysiology rig from off-the-shelf open-source components. We are working toward a future where neuroscience labs run on open standards. This doesn’t mean that every part of your rig needs to be open source, just that common interfaces let you choose the right tool for every job. Open standards foster healthier competition and enhance creativity by allowing the best ideas to propagate without the need to reinvent any wheels.
