[FENS](https://forum.fens.org/), the Federation of European Neuroscience Societies, will be having its next forum in July in Paris. This is the largest international neuroscience meeting in Europe, covering all fields of neuroscience research and comprising a range of symposia, technical workshops, plenary and special lectures and poster sessions as well as a number of social events.

[Open-Neuroscience](https://open-neuroscience.com/) in collaboration with the [Institut Pasteur neuroscience department](https://www.pasteur.fr/fr/nos-missions/recherche/neuroscience) and the [University of Sussex neuroscience department](https://www.sussex.ac.uk/research/centres/sussex-neuroscience/) organises a [satellite event](https://forum.fens.org/confirmed-satellite-events/) on Open Hardware Microscopy Development. The aim of this event is to bring into focus excellent open projects that permeate education, ease of access and data collection in advanced research environment.

The symposium will take place on the [Pasteur Institute campus](https://www.google.com/maps/d/viewer?ie=UTF8&view=map&ctz=-480&t=h&oe=UTF8&msa=0&mid=19wRKz7elGVxBkOFzIW-kZzMac0o&ll=48.840152518324395%2C2.311734201396951&z=18) in Paris (28 rue du Dr Roux). It will be divided into a [workshop session](#Morning-workshop-session) in the morning and a [series of talk](#Afternoon-talk-session) in the afternoon.

The workshops will be led by specialists in the field, which will also participate in the afternoon session. By the end of the session, participants will be invited to discuss what they have learned, how they could implement Open-Science microscope in their research, and/or how they could improve/modify their own setup by implementing Open tools on it and how their research protocol could benefit from it.

The afternoon session will be dedicated to a series of talks by our invited specialists. It will be split into two distinct topics/sub-sessions: Open-Source microscopy for education and improving ease of access to research equipment, and Open-Source microscopy for advanced research.
 
It is our goal that by the end of the day, participants get a full picture of the state of the art for Open-Source Microscopy. It is hoped that development and implementation of such tools and techniques in modern research units promote science accessibility and improve data reproducibility. Furthermore, an earlier and more systematic access to advanced science tools in education could only support shaping the research minds of tomorrow.





## Morning workshop session
<p align="justify">
The aim of this symposium is to bring together scientists from Life Sciences
Following the “Symposium on Open-Source Hardware for Neuroscience Research” we hosted as part of the FENS 2018 workshops in Berlin, we are aiming to organise for the upcoming edition, a full day satellite event on Open Hardware Microscopy Development. We aim to bring into focus excellent open projects that permeate education, ease of access and data collection in advanced research environment. Our main targeted audience are graduate students and ECRs.

## Afternoon talk session
In 2018, we organised as part of the conference workshop events, a symposium on Open Hardware. During this event our speakers presented an overview of today’s possibilities to cheaply and efficiently build state-of-the-art research equipment using only 3D printed components, microcontrollers and off-the-shelf electronic sensors and actuators. Moreover we presented use cases of these types of development in research, education and global capacity building, with examples taken from the Western and Central Europe as well as sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America. </p>

The event will take place at the Duclaux theatre on the Pasteur Institute campus in Paris (28 rue du Dr Roux). It will be divided into a workshop session in the morning and a lecture session in the afternoon.

The morning session will consist of hands-on activities, where participants will be introduced to three major Open-Source Hardware microscopy projects that have been fully developed and used for both education purposes and on-field research. Participants will then have the opportunity to select one of these projects, and learn how to conceive, build and operate an Open-Science microscope.
The workshops will be led by specialists in the field, which will also participate in the afternoon session. By the end of the session, participants will be invited to discuss what they have learned, how they could implement Open-Science microscope in their research, and/or how they could improve/modify their own setup by implementing Open tools on it and how their research protocol could benefit from it.

The afternoon session will be dedicated to a series of talks by our invited specialists. It will be split into two distinct topics/sub-sessions: Open-Source microscopy for education and improving ease of access to research equipment, and Open-Source microscopy for advanced research.
It is our goal that by the end of the day, participants get a full picture of the state of the art for Open-Source Microscopy.
