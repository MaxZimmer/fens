[FENS](https://forum.fens.org), the Federation of European Neuroscience Societies, will be having its next forum in July in Paris. This is the largest international neuroscience meeting in Europe, covering all fields of neuroscience research and comprising a range of symposia, technical workshops, plenary and special lectures and poster sessions as well as a number of social events.


Following the “Symposium on Open-Source Hardware for Neuroscience Research” we hosted as part of the FENS 2018 workshops in Berlin, we are aiming to organise for the upcoming edition, a full day satellite event on Open Hardware Microscopy Development. We aim to bring into focus excellent open projects that permeate education, ease of access and data collection in advanced research environment. Our main targeted audience are graduate students and ECRs.

In 2018, we organised as part of the conference workshop events, a symposium on Open Hardware. During this event our speakers presented an overview of today’s possibilities to cheaply and efficiently build state-of-the-art research equipment using only 3D printed components, microcontrollers and off-the-shelf electronic sensors and actuators. Moreover we presented use cases of these types of development in research, education and global capacity building, with examples taken from the Western and Central Europe as well as sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America. </p>
